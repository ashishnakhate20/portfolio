Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Lovely Professional University](https://www.lpu.in/). My interest in coding started back in 2022 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/u/Mishraji_op/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2022-2026) with 7.32 GPA aggregate.

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Node.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
